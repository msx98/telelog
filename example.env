SENTENCE_TRANSFORMERS_MODEL_NAME="paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2" # Probably not a good model for our purposes
#SENTENCE_TRANSFORMERS_HOME="/app/models" # <-- only set this here if you intend to clone the model not during the Docker image build, but during runtime (e.g. to a volume). I think this isn't a good idea in cloud providers like RunPod, because then you pay for GPU runtime for something that could've been done as part of the Docker clone. Also, comment out "ENV SENTENCE_TRANSFORMERS_HOME..." in all Dockerfiles that have it
